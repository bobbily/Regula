## Overview

This mod creates a number of traits, events, schemes, and interactions based around the Player's interaction with the Regula Magistri (Rule of the Master). The intent of these is to create a state headed by a single (male) ruler and his female vassal concubines. 


## Highlights

Creates a mind controller trait for the MC (Keeper of Souls) and a charmed trait for female characters (Mulsa).

Creates a religion, Regula Magistri. This religion has a custom marriage doctrine (Sacred Concubines) that allows unlimited concubines.

Creates a scheme (Fascinare) to add the Mulsa trait to female characters and convert them to the Regula Magistri religion.

Creates two new gender succession laws, Hereditas Magistri and Hereditas Compedita. The MC's titles pass to their male offspring, while those of their vassals pass to female offspring. All MC vassals will adopt Hereditas Compedita on a quarterly basis.


## Requirements

At present this mod is standalone.


## Incompatibilities

This mod will conflict with anything that modifies gender succession laws. Otherwise it should run alongside anything up to and including total conversion mods (not extensively tested).

This mod should be save-game compatible.


## Installation
