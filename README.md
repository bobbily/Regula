## Overview
This mod creates a number of traits, events, schemes, and interactions based around the Player's interaction with the Regula Magistri (Rule of the Master). The intent of these is to create a state headed by a single (male) ruler and his female vassal concubines. 


## Highlights

Creates a mind controller trait for the MC (Keeper of Souls) and charmed traits for female characters (Mulsa, Paelex, Domina and Orba).

Creates a religion, Regula Magistri. This religion has two custom tenets linked to the Magister and his concubinage, as well as a custom marriage doctrine (Magisterian Concubinage) that allows unlimited concubines.

Creates a scheme (Fascinare) to add the Mulsa trait to female characters and convert them to the Regula Magistri religion. Each woman with the Mulsa and at least one landed title (county or higher) can be upgraded to the Paelex trait and added to the MC's harem.

Women with the Paelex trait can be promoted to Domina, taking up the usual wife slot. They can be demoted back to Paelex just as easily.

Creates two new gender succession laws, Hereditas Magistri and Hereditas Compedita. The MC's titles pass to their male offspring, while those of their vassals pass to female offspring. All MC vassals will adopt Hereditas Compedita on a quarterly basis.

A number of under the hood interactions. Notably, women who leave the concubinage (kicked out/MC dies) gain the strongly negative Orba trait. They can be recruited back into a concubinage for a minor piety gain.


## Requirements
At present this mod is standalone.


## Incompatibilities
This mod will conflict with anything that modifies gender succession laws or religious tenets. Otherwise it should run alongside anything up to and including total conversion mods (not extensively tested).

This version is not compatible with Regula Magestri 0.1 saves.


## Installation
Unzip into your /Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/mod folder.
